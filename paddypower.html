<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p5">Over the space of two weeks I made a proposal for a design project featured on People Per Hour (www.peopleperhour.com). The project was sub-contracted through a design agency and freelancer, most of the work consisted of altering pre-made mobile layouts and editing or creating further content for design accuracy and quality. This was all created as a .psd (photoshop file that could be used by the developers who build and work on the mobile web application. The client was fully satisfied with my work and I recieved £200 at the end of the project with a £60 desposit before I started. The client is featured on People Per Hour and has asked for my services in future work that may come up. I also recieved a 5 star review on people per hour for my profile.</p>
