<p class="p1">ORIGAMI</p>

<p class="p2">Web Application</p>

<p class="p3">Overview</p>

<p class="p4">A web application that teaches users to create various types of Origami such as planes, boats and animals. The purpose of this project was to challenge my self in my third and final year of University. The development process required me to explore UI/UX Design, Illustration and coding. There is also a <a href="http://goo.gl/bdMGMh" target="_blank">live version</a> of the project that it is currently only compatible with smartphones.</p>

<p class="p3">Features</p>

<p class="p4">Compatible with Smartphones</p>

<p class="p4">User-Friendly Navigation</p>

<p class="p3">Development</p>

<p class="p4">Over twelve weeks my challenge was to design and develop a fully functional web app that could be used with smartphones. The initial idea for the app was based on tutorials for crafting paper planes. This later expanded to all types of Origami.</p>

<p class="p4">The first stage of the design process was to create the content. This included both artwork and text that would be featured in the app.</p>
