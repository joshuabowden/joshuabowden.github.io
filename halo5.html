<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p4">A photo-manipulation project which is based on a concept design for a video game cover 'Halo 5'. The design includes some copyright material from various sources such as the game developers. The idea of this project was to create it for fun as a mockup design and for non-commercial/personal use. My goals with this project were to experiment with photo-retouching and create an artwork that could potentially be used as a professional game cover.</p>

<p class="p3">DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p class="p3v2">Introduction</p>

<p class="p4">The process of this project required me to gather design materials such as stock images including flares, flames or fire and dust particles for use with photo-retouching. By using these images I could layer them with various blend styles to create assets such as realistic explosions. The flares were mostly used for creating glowing and lighting effects on the characters helmet and visor.</p>

<p class="p3v2">Design and Development</p>

<p class="p5">To create the correct lighting meant using a variety of adjustments in Photoshop such as Brightness/Contrast, Exposure, Hue/Sat, Colour Balance, Photo Filter and Gradient Maps. Some of the images used in the artwork such as the character were not designed by my self and taken from external sources such as google images.</p>
