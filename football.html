<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p4">A recent User Interface project for a company called Football Form Labs. The challenge was to create a design that would be suitable for all users including those specifically interested in football betting. The outcome of the design is elegant and focuses on creating a user experience that relates to football.</p>

<p class="p3v2">Introduction</p>

<p class="p4">After attending an interview with Football Form Labs as a graphic designer, the company asked if I could produce a small project for them to help with the applicant decisions process. This project began with a basic wireframe of a widget that they had asked to be re-designed. One feature they were particularly asking for is the design to be extremeley clear and understandable to all users.</p>

<p class="p4">The purpose of this application is to provide people interested in the betting industry with football based statistics. For example, this may include football match statistics that show the teams that are most likely to win.</p> 

<p class="p3v2">Sketches</p>

<p class="p5">With the project brief in mind the first step began with some basic sketches of user interface wire-frames. Some of my initial design ideas were to use simple drop down menus for each section featured within the widget.</p>
