<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p4">A recent User Interface project for a company called Football Form Labs. The challenge was to create a design that would be suitable for all users including those specifically interested in football betting. The outcome of the design is elegant and focuses on creating an experience that relates to football.</p>

<p class="p3">FEATURES</p>

<p class="p4">User-Freindly Navigation</p>

<p class="p4">Compatible with Smartphones</p>

<p class="p4">Engaging Visuals</p>

<p class="p3">DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p class="p4">After attending an interview with Football Form Labs as a graphic designer, the company asked if I could produce a small project for them to help with the applicant decisions process.</p>

<p class="p5">The project began with a basic wireframe of a widget that they had asked to be re-designed with my creativity. One feature they were particularly asking for is the design to be extremeley clear and understandable to all users.</p>
