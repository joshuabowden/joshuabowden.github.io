<main>

<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p4">A photo-manipulation project which is a re-creational poster for the upcoming film Avengers: Age of Ultron. The idea of this project has been to experiment with photo-retouching in Photoshop and create the perfect lighting and effects for a film poster. The images used within the design are mostly from google and have been tampered with to produce the outcome. One of the reasons I chose to do this project is due to my excitement for the film release and interest in films.</p>

<p class="p3">DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p class="p5">This particular project consisted of a high amount of hours re-creating the effect of a snow blizzard within the poster. The lighting effects also took a lot of work especially adding all of the missing details to the character such as glistening, light ups and motion to show the character in movement. The background and colour corrections also had to match the snow theme.</p>
