<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p5">A photo-manipulation project; retouch of a stock image featuring a jet. This included none of the splashes or water featured in this image. The project took several hours and was extemely challenging to re-create the effect of an authentic plane crash in to the sea. Although this is the final image outcome I would of ideally improved this with further work. Some of the other earlier stages of this project made it look as though the jet was sinking instead of crashing which I prefered as it looked a lot more realistic. The stock photos of the sea and jet were taken from sources in google images.</p>
