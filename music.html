<p class="p3">Overview</p>

<p class="p4">A re-design of Apple's Music Application. The purpose of this project was to explore a concept idea that removes a lot of features from an app and replaces them with a creative User Interface. Touch gestures could be used in a different way than usual with the user simply pressing and holding down on the bottom part of the screen to reveal options such as Shuffle and Loop. Swipe gestures could be used for switching songs.</p>
