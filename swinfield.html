<main>

<p class="p3">OVERVIEW</p>

<p class="p4">A simple logo design for a client called Abigail Swinfield. The client asked for a logo that could be used for personal and commercial use as a professional graphic designer. The concept is loosely based on the letters 'A' and 'S'. Other uses for the logo design are printed stickers and stylish prints. The final logo design consists of two different versions each the same with different colour variations (e.g. green and white).</p>

<p class="p3">DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p class="p3v2">Introduction</p>

<p class="p5">The development process for the logo design began with some simple sketches of the letter 'A'. After sketching out a variety of versions it was then illustrated and vectorized in Illustrator as a proffesional logo. The original logo design consisted of being changed over threee times to create the ideal version for the client. The last process included changing the colour of both the logo and background.</p>
