<p class="sub-title">BACKGROUND</p>

<p class="paragraph2">The projects featured on my portfolio are based on creative User Interface and User Experiences. Some of the projects are simple re-designs of website home pages that gave me inspiration to create unique layouts. I am also currently working to develop my designs as live projects e.g. a fully functional website. This has inspired me to learn more about code and devloping responsive designs. My skills are strongly based in Photoshop which is my primary program of choice when designing any interface projects. In the past I've also worked on Logos, Photo-Manipulation and Illustration.</p>
